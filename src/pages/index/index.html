<p>This is my workshop for the class <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/images">Image and video processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a stop at the hospital</a></p>
<p>Since I have no professional use for Mathlab, I will be using client-side Javascript and Canvas to do the exercises and practice.</p>
<p>Feel free to use, fork and share the code.</p>
